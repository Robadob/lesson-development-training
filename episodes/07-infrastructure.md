::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Identify the key tools used in The Carpentries lesson infrastructure.
- Complete the fundamental setup steps for a new lesson repository.
- Edit Markdown files using the GitHub web interface.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How is a lesson site set up and published with GitHub?
- What are the essential configuration steps for a new lesson?
- How do you create and modify the pages in a lesson?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

At this stage in the training, 
you should have a clear idea of who the people are that you want to teach this lesson to,
and what exactly the skills are that you want them to learn while they are following it.
It is time to begin creating a lesson website that will present that lesson to the world!

The source of all The Carpentries lessons is made publicly-available in repositories on [GitHub].
GitHub provides a hosting service to open source projects such as these,
allowing users to present their projects to the wider world,
including a complete history of the changes made between versions of the individual files in the project,
and features to facilitate collaboration on projects.
We will learn more about some of those collaborative features later in this training.
For now, we will focus on one other important feature that GitHub provides: website hosting.

Via a system called **GitHub Pages**, users can build and host websites 
from relatively simple text files present in any repository on GitHub.
For many years, this has been how The Carpentries lesson websites have been presented to the world.
Our lesson sites used to be generated by software called _[Jekyll]_, 
a tool which is built into GitHub Pages that allows the webpage content, written in the text files of the repository, to be combined with descriptions of settings, structure, styling to create a relatively complex website.

In 2022, we adopted a new infrastructure for our lesson sites: **The Carpentries Workbench**.
Lesson sites built on the Workbench are still hosted with GitHub Pages,
but forego Jekyll in favour of a programming language, _[R]_, and _[pandoc]_, 
a software designed for converting content between file formats.
The Workbench combines three R packages:

- `{sandpaper}`: 
   converts a collection of Markdown or RMarkdown files into
   the structure of a lesson website.
- `{varnish}`: provides the files and folders that add 
   styling and additional functionality to a lesson website.
- `{pegboard}`: an programmatic interface to the lesson, 
   enabling various automated validation tasks.

For lesson developers, the Workbench makes The Carpentries lesson repositories
much simpler to navigate and work with.
We will use it now to initialise a new lesson.

To get started, we first need to create a new repository for your lesson.
We will use a template to do this, 
so that the new repository contains the basic files and folders
that the Workbench needs in order to build a lesson site.
There are currently two templates to choose between:

1. [An RMarkdown template][rmd-template], best suited to lessons that will include a lot of R source code.
2. [A Markdown template][md-template], which is the simpler choice for all other lessons.

**One member of each participating lesson team** should choose one of these templates, 
following the link above and completing the configuration as follows:

* select `carpentries-incubator` instead of your own GitHub username
* add a name for the repository
  * The name should be descriptive but fairly brief,
    with hyphens (`-`) to separate words
* in the "Description" field, write the title of your lesson
* choose "Public" visibility
* leave "Include all branches" **unchecked**

After pressing the "Create repository using this template" button,
you should be presented with a brand new lesson repository.

TODO insert screenshot of repository structure here

The repository contains a number of files and folders.
Most of these are source files for the content of your new lesson,
but a few are accompanying files primarily intended for the repository itself
rather than the lesson website.
These are:

- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `LICENSE.md`
- `README.md`
- `.gitignore`
- and the `.github/` folder.

We will explore the repository extensively during the rest of the training.
For now, we can complete the initialisation of this new lesson repository by (TODO: expand on these points):

* adding collaborators
* annotating your repository with topics
* activating GitHub Pages to begin serving the lesson website (`gh-pages` branch)
  * copy URL and add to repository description

After following these steps, when you navigate to the pages URL, you should be see a lesson website with The Carpentries logo and "Lesson Title" in the top-left corner.

The lesson title can be adjusted by modifying the `config.yaml` file in the repository.




- The Carpentries lesson infrastructure
  - The components: (R)Markdown, GitHub
  - How they fit together to create a lesson website
- Creating a new lesson repository
- Initial lesson configuration
  - TODO initialisation steps for a `sandpaper` lesson
  - completing lesson repository setup (topics, lesson URL, README.md)
- Add list of prerequisites as bullet list on `index.md`

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Exercise: practice editing Markdown in GitHub (5 minutes)

Add the objectives you defined for your lesson
as another bullet list in the `index.md` file of your lesson repository.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- Creating a new episode
  - Add a title and define objectives for this episode

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Exercise: practice creating episodes (10 minutes)

Repeat the steps you just saw, to create another new episode file.
If you know what another episode in your lesson will be about,
create the page for that.
Otherwise, feel free to use any values you like for the file name, episode title, etc.
