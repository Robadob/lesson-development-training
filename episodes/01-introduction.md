## Our First Exercise (10 minutes)

What was the best lesson you ever followed (were taught in a class, read through online, read in a book)?
Try to differentiate between what was good about the performance of the teacher/trainer
and what was good about the content of the lesson itself.
Take a few minutes to write down some notes about your answer,
then introduce yourself to the other participants and tell them about it.
