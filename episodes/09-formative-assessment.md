- With learning objectives you have defined your *intended* curriculum.
- What learners leave with after the lesson/workshop (*attained* curriculum) will be a combination of *implemented* and *hidden* curriculum.
  - Implemented curriculum: the concepts, relationships, and skills that are explicitly covered in your lesson.
  - Hidden curriculum: the additional things, not directly addressed in the content, that people learn about the topic from your lesson/the way it is taught.
    - You can use Instructor Notes to guide Instructors on some of the important hidden curriculum to consider e.g. to encourage them to model certain practices.
- [The goal of the remaining steps of lesson development is to ensure that the attained curriculum matches the intended curriculum as closely as possible](https://f1000research.com/documents/9-1377).
- Assessments are a way to determine whether the objectives you defined for the lesson/a section of the lesson have been reached
  - Formative assessments during the workshop
  - Summative assessments at the end.
  - For short-format workshops, formative assessments are usually more valuable
    and easier to implement in practice.
    They help you maximise the value of the workshop for learners while they are there.
  - They also help with *metacognition* -
    the awareness a learner has that they are succeeding in learning something new.
- Exercises are one important type of formative assessment
- Mental models and misconceptions
  - 27+15=42 MCQ example from Instructor Training
  - In addition to the prior knowledge we want learners to have they also have knowledge that can lead to misconceptions. 
  - It is important to detect misconceptions as early as possible
    and formative assessments should help you do this
- Learners get feedback about what they have misunderstood - guided practice

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Explain what is meant by the intended and attained curriculum of a lesson.
- Describe the importance of regular assessment while a lesson is being taught.
- Design assessments to identify the misconceptions learners might have during your lesson.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How can you measure learners' progress towards your lesson objectives?
- Why is it important to identify misconceptions as early as possible?
- Why should we create assessments before we have written the explanatory content of our lesson?

## Exercise: misconceptions (5 minutes)

What is a common misconceptions learners can have about the topic of your lesson?
How might you identify that misconception in your learners while they follow your lesson?
Share your answer in the collaborative notes document.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Exercise: designing a diagnostic exercise (20 minutes)

Create a multiple choice question (MCQ) that could be used in your lesson,
to detect the misconception you identified above.
As well as the correct answer,
include 1-3 answer options that are not obviously incorrect (*plausible distractors*)
and have *diagnostic power*
i.e. each incorrect answer helps you pinpoint the exact misconception carried by the learner.

Share your MCQ in the collaborative notes document.

## Exercise: reviewing formative assessments (10 minutes)

**(this exercise will only work if participants have sufficient knowledge of their partner's topic)**

The Trainers will group you into pairs.

Review the MCQ designed by your partner. When providing feedback, try to answer the following questions:

- Is the question clear and easy to understand? Could the wording be improved in some way?
- Are the incorrect answers to the MCQ plausible distractors?
- Do the incorrect answers provide diagnostic power, to help an Instructor identify the misconception the learner has?
- Are there any incorrect answers missing i.e. are there other misconceptions that could be detected with this MCQ?

Share your feedback in the collaborative notes document.
