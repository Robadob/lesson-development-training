title: How to write a lesson
teaching: 30
exercises: 40

- Explanatory text is the connective tissue between your examples and exercises
  (I read this way of describing it somewhere - need to find the reference...).
  The goal is to ensure coherent flow from one exercise to another.
- How much is too much? I.e. how verbose should your explanatory content be?
  - A question of personal style, and preference for in-person vs self-directed learning (see below)
  - but the aim is to provide all the relevant information
    with a minimum of additional content that is not directly required
    (extraneous cognitive load and wasted time)
    to help learners reach the objectives you have set out.
- In many Carpentries lessons, callout boxes are used for asides and short tangents
  e.g. points that might be relevant to some audiences but are not essential to the flow of the lesson.
  (As such, they should be kept to a minimum.)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Estimate the time required to teach a lesson.
- Summarise the content of a lesson as a set of questions and key points.
- Connect the examples and exercises in a lesson with its learning objectives.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- Why do we write explanatory content last?
- How can I avoid demotivating learners?
- How can I prioritise what to keep and what to cut when a lesson is too long?

## Lesson pages for the instructor and the learner

TODO brief discussion of trade-offs between preparing a lesson site for
use as an instructional guide vs use as a self-directed learning resource.
(notes below)

Self-directed learning resources tend to be more verbose,
where instructional guides can be aimed at an audience more able to "read between the lines."
Very sparse text is less likely to be re-usable by other Instructors.
In general, it is not a good idea to assume others (learners or instructors)
will know what you were thinking when you wrote the content
so, if in doubt, be explicit.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  discussion

## Discussion (10 minutes)

At what point is a lesson too long?
How might you prioritise what to keep if you have to cut it down?


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- Reminder: trying to fit too much content into a lesson is counter-productive.
  It is better to cover less and teach people less,
  than to cover more and teach people even less
- Also worth considering the (realistic) maximum viable length of a workshop
  that would teach your lesson
  e.g. it is unusual to be able to convince people to attend a workshop that lasts four full days.
  (and better to teach people two days-worth of material than teach no-one four days-worth.)
  Carpentries workshops have settled on two days,
  but many in our community run three-day workshops to cover additional material.
- What is it essential that you include?
  What can you leave out if you have to?
  - Are there intermediate checkpoints that you can write in,
    so that the workshop is not reliant on getting through the whole lesson to
    "bring everything together?"
- In the end, the only way to know for sure is to pilot the lesson,
  measuring how long it takes to teach. (link to pilot notes template)
  But, as a general rule,
  it is better to assume that you are under-estimating
  rather than over-estimating the length.
  Experience suggests that that is most likely correct,
  and anyway it is better to have spare time for discussion,
  revisiting exercises, etc
  than to try to rush through the remaining material in limited time.
  - If, after teaching your new lesson, you find that you did not have time to cover all the content,
    approach cutting down the lesson by identifying which learning objectives to remove.
    Then take out the objective(s) and the corresponding assessment(s) and explanatory content.
- Consider adding suggestions for objectives that can be skipped to the Instructor Notes for the lesson.
- Managing cognitive load

*"the five ways to handle an extraneous overload situation are to:*

- *eliminate extraneous material (coherence principle),*
- *insert signals emphasizing the essential material (signaling principle),*
- *eliminate redundant printed text (redundancy principle),*
- *place printed text next to corresponding parts of graphics (spatial contiguity principle), and*
- *eliminate the need to hold essential material in working memory for long periods of time (temporal contiguity principle)."*

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- How can you avoid demotivating your learners?
  - Dismissive language, stereotypes (check your learner profiles too!)
  - Expert awareness gap
  - Think back to 27+15=42 MCQ example and
    how challenging it can be to remember the common mistakes in something you mastered a long time ago
- Fluid representations, unexplained or unnecessary jargon, unexplained assumptions, sudden jumps in difficulty/complexity
- Accessibility
  - Avoid regional/cultural references and idioms that will not translate across borders/cultures
  - Contractions
  - Alternative text for figures/images (including for data visualisations [https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81](https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81)) - [the Workbench documentation describes how to add alt-text and captions to images in a lesson](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/episodes.html#figures)
  - Header hierarchy (no h1 headers in the lesson body, no skipped levels e.g. h2 -> h4)
  - Use descriptive link text - no "click here" or "this page" etc
  - Image contrast \& tools to check this

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Exercise: Alternative text for images (5 minutes)

TODO/exclude to free up some time

multiple choice question with an example image and a few different options for alt text.
Ask trainees to choose the most appropriate option.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- Defining key terms and Glosario
- Questions and key points
  - what and who are these for? how do they tend to be used?

Add key points and questions to your episode.

## Reflection Exercise (20 minutes)

TODO based on
"Map out the relationships between the LOs,
the LEs via which they will be delivered \& those specific items of content
(e.g., item A sup- ports LO 1, \& will be delivered using a lecture).

- Is there any piece of content that doesn't support any LO(s)?
- Is there at least one piece of content for each LO?
- Is there at least one LE for each piece of content?"

What do you still need to add/work on? What can you remove/consider removing?
What diagram or other visual aid could you add to supplement your text?
