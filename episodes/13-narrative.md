## Creating a narrative

<!--- Should this section go before LO and questions? -->

Writing your lesson as a story helps learners stay motivated and engaged.
The story you create can also help learners more easily connect how the skills they
are learning to how the skills could be useful after the workshop.
You can enable learners to make connections between the what they learn in your lesson to their
own work by creating a narrative that resembles a situation the learners might
encounter in their own work.
Depending on the tool you are teaching, you might also include a particular dataset as a part of the story you are weaving into your lesson.
It is common for lessons to include a dataset that is used in examples and discussed throughout.
This can help you maintain a narrative flow and make the lesson feel more authentic
Even if your topic doesn't require a dataset, deciding on a consistent narrative will
help create a flow between lessons and reduce cognitive load for learners.


## Finding a dataset

When searching for a dataset to use in your lesson, 
there are a number of factors to consider.
First, if possible you want the dataset to be an authentic use
case for researchers in your target audience.
This means balancing the size and complexity of a dataset
while avoiding additional cognative load for learners.
The dataset may need a certain number of observations
to demonstrate some of the skills you are teaching or have a
realistic number of variables to what learners many encounter
in their work to feel authentic.
At the same time, you want your learners to be able to interpret the
data fairly easily during the lesson so they can focus on the skills
you are teaching.
This may mean you will need to subset your dataset or remove variables
observed.
You may want to also include and review a data dictionary in your lesson,
explicitly taking the time to review the information included in the
dataset.
An additional factor to consider when choosing a dataset to include is 
the license.
You want to find a dataset where the data provider allows for you to freely use it.
The best option is a dataset with a CC0 (Public Domain Dedication) license, as
other licenses may have more ambiguity around data reuse.
Lessons included in the [Carpentries Incubator](https://carpentries-incubator.org/) will need to use CC0 licensed data.
Even with a CC0 license, you will still want to follow best practice in 
giving attribution to the data provider or collecting agency.

An example dataset used in the Data Carpentry Ecology lessons is the [Portal
Project Teaching Database](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459).  This dataset is an actual ecological research project that was simplified for teaching.



- Finding \& modifying a dataset
  - Size - large enough to be authentic
    (and to demonstrate the benefits of learning the skills you are teaching),
    ideally not so large that download and storage become prohibitive
  - Complexity - complex enough to be authentic,
    but not so complex that it takes a long time for learners to understand what it contains
    - It should be easy enough for all learners to get to grips with quickly,
      so they can focus on the skills you are teaching
      without being distracted by the unfamiliarity and/or complexity of the data set.
      But it should also feel authentic and
      not be over-simplified to the point of giving false impressions of what it is like to work with real data.
      Try to strike a balance.
      Do not be afraid to down-sample, remove columns, etc where you can.
  - License - CC0 so that you can modify and redistribute it freely without
    fear of accidentally breaking the terms of the license - TODO example? (Sarah S: Maybe the portal dataset from DC Ecology? - [https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Portal\_Project\_Teaching\_Database/1314459](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459))
  - Ethical/cultural considerations TODO - this needs fleshing out
    - [CARE principles](https://datascience.codata.org/articles/10.5334/dsj-2020-043/)
    - Are some members of your audience likely to find the data upsetting or offensive?

### Examples of public repositories

- Examples of public repositories that could be good places to look for a data set to use in your lesson:
  - Dryad
  - DCN's curated data sets
  - domain-specific repositories
  - Data.europa.eu
  - DataONE

## Exercise: Choosing a data set or narrative (30 minutes)

Referring to the advice given above, find an appropriate dataset or a narrative for your lesson.
Identify one or more potential candidates and note down the advantages and disadvantages of each one.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- What story will your lesson tell?
  - Teach most useful first -
    make sure learners do not have to sit through hours of teaching before they
    learn something really powerful.
    Try to front load the lesson with the (i.e. the most useful) things the learners want to learn.
  - Even better, try to front load with things the learners *want* to learn.

## Exercise: Examples before exercises (20 minutes)

Looking back at one of the exercises you designed before:
what examples could you include in your narrative to teach learners the skills
they will need to apply to complete the formative assessments you have designed?

Outline one of these examples in your episode file.

## Summary / Last points
<!--- needs  a better heading title-->

- Even if you do not need a data set for your lesson, you should decide on a narrative
  - Centering lesson around a central example reduces cognitive of switching between examples throughout the lesson
  - Authenticity vs complexity again
  - Same considerations of motivation, accessibility as before
