title: Preparing to teach
teaching: 15
exercises: 30

By now you should have developed
objectives,
exercises/formative assessments,
and examples
for at least one of the episodes in your lesson.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Summarise lesson content as a teaching plan.
- Add setup instructions and Instructor Notes to the lesson site.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- What can I do to prepare to teach my lesson for the first time?
- What information should be recorded for instructors teaching a lesson?
- How should I communicate lesson setup instructions to learners?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Exercise: Prepare a teaching plan (15 minutes)

Create a bullet point list or brief notes describing
what you will say and do when teaching the episode you have been focussing on
during this training.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  testimonial

*"I usually create detailed notes organised in a concept map/workflow in order to make everything consistent.
I also write next to each bit of teaching the time approximately needed.
For each lesson I create (and reuse when I teach again the same lesson)
very detailed notes of what happens during the lesson,
including teaching goals and LO(s) I mean to achieve with each bit of lesson.
This rich lesson plan requires a lot of work the first time I teach a lesson,
but reduces a lot the preparation time of future lessons and are super useful to other teachers."*

\- Dr. Allegra Via, Carpentries Instructor and Instructor Trainer

- Using figures and visual aids
  - Remember the alt text
  - Call back to placing explanatory text adjacent to relevant part of visualisation
- Working with the lesson infrastructure:
  - Setup instructions
    - This is time well-invested. Clear instructions now may give you more time when teaching the lesson.
  - Discuss briefly what belongs in Instructor Notes pages:
    - strengths and weaknesses of current design
    - what has been tried before and what worked/did not work
    - tips for teaching the lesson/particular sections
    - challenges encountered
    - parts that seem to cause biggest trouble/most confusion for learners (i.e. where to tread carefully), etc
- Collecting feedback
  - a reminder of some of the methods for collecting feedback that can be most helpful for a trial run
    - minute cards
    - one up, one down
    - perhaps even some more specific feedback, for a relatively short trial run e.g. how clear were the exercises? were they appropriately challenging i.e. learner felt like they had to think about it to complete the challenge, but not so difficult that they gave up/became frustrated.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  discussion

## What questions do you have? (15 minutes)

The homework from this workshop includes a trial run of one of the episodes
you have been developing in your lesson, to a real audience.

Thinking about this task, what questions do you have about how you should
approach teaching that trial run?
Is there anything you are unsure of?
What resources might help you prepare for that experience?

## Exercise: homework

The final part of this training will focus on the skills needed to collaborate
effectively. Before that there will be a break,
during which we would like you to complete the following three tasks:

1. Teach one episode of your lesson (probably the one you have been working on in these two days)
   See the [Lesson Trial Runs](../learners/trial-runs.md) page for full details.
2. After your trial run has concluded
   (immediately after, or when you have reviewed any feedback you collected from learners),
   note down your answers to the following questions:
   - What worked?
   - What did not?
   - What will you do differently next time?
   - What will you change in your material you taught?
     We will refer to these notes when we reconvene for the last section of this training.
3. Based on your experience teaching the material and the feedback you received from your learners and helpers,
   make a list of issues you have identified with the material you prepared, e.g.
   - examples that did not work as expected,
   - improvements that could be made to exercises,
   - parts that learners found particularly challenging,
   - unexpected questions or misconceptions that came up during the trial run,
   - etc.
     We will return to these notes during the final training session,
     so please make sure you save them somewhere you will be able to find them again easily when the time comes.
