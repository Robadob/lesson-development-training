title: Identifying your target audience
teaching: 25
exercises: 20

We will use a modified version of [Nicholl's five phases of curriculum design][1],
adapted to place an emphasis on assessing learning during a workshop:

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Describe the importance of aligning lesson design with the intended audience.
- Compose a list of prior knowledge required to follow a lesson.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- What are the recommended steps to take when developing a new lesson?
- Why is it so important to think about the target audience early in the process?
- How can you ensure that your lesson reaches the right audience?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

1. Define desired learning outcomes
2. Decide with what activities/examples/explanations we will try to teach these skills
3. Create assessments to determine progress towards desired outcomes
4. Write content to lead learners from one of these assessments to the next
5. (After the break) evaluate how closely the outcomes meet the objectives

Given the limited time in a short-format training,
it is vital to define the scope of the lesson i.e.
what people will know before and after the lesson.
That means thinking carefully about the target audience.
This will also help attract people with the right motivation and relevant prior knowledge to attend your workshops.

[The Carpentries model of how people gain expertise][2]: novice -> competent practitioner -> expert

- Why this matters when designing a new lesson
  - Prior knowledge of audience mental models: what do they already know?
  - Novices and competent practitioners need to be taught differently

Your lesson will also be more effective if it aligns with the motivations of the target audience
(quote from/link to Ambrose et al).

Think about who your lesson is for. Be specific.

- What kind of background might your learners have?
- What problems are they facing that your lesson can help them solve?
- What do they already know about the topic?
- What other considerations might you need to make e.g. their primary language differ from yours, etc?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Exercise: thinking about target audience (15 minutes total for both parts)

Part 1 (5 minutes): think about a member of the target audience for your lesson,
and answer the following questions:

1. What is their background?
2. What do they already know how to do?
3. What do they want to do with the skills they will learn from your lesson?
4. What problem will your lesson help them solve?

::::::::::::::  solution

## Part 2a (for groups collaborating on the same lesson, 10 minutes)

Share your answers with your collaborators. How do they compare?
If you have identified different audiences, are they compatible?
Or would your time be better spent focussing on one particular audience for this lesson?


:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::  solution

## Part 2b (for participants developing their lesson alone, 10 minutes)

Write 1-2 diagnostic questions, for use before the lesson is taught,
to help you assess whether a respondent falls within the intended audience for your lesson.



:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Exercise: defining prerequisite knowledge (5 minutes)

Write a list of the skills/knowledge your learners will be required to have
before they can follow your lesson.
