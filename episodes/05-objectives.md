title: Defining lesson objectives/outcomes
teaching: 30
exercises: 50

To ensure your audience stays motivated, and your lesson feels relevant to them,
it helps to focus on teaching skills not tools
i.e. lessons should be centered around what you are empowering learners to do,
what will be most beneficial to them,
This is as opposed to exploring features or commands for the sake of completeness,
because they are new,
or because they are interesting to you from a theoretical perspective.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Explain the importance of defining specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound objectives for a lesson.
- Evaluate a written lesson objective according to these criteria.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How can describing the things you intend to teach aid the process of writing a lesson?
- How can you be specific and realistic about what you will teach in your lesson?
- What are some of the risks associated with unrealistic or undefined expectations of a lesson?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The desired end point (the objective) of a lesson should be new things that the learner can do.
Cognitive skills cannot be equally easily acquired:
before we can apply concepts and create something new, we must attain the ability to remember 
and distinguish between new concepts. 
Remembering and distinguishing are also abilities that are often faster to gain then applying or creating.

We must try to be realistic about how far along this scale we can move learners during a single workshop/lesson.
This is one reason why the target audience is so important:
if we can predict what learners will know when they arrive at the lesson,
we can better define the outcomes we can expect when they leave.
We can also use definition of target audience to better select learners who will
arrive with the appropriate prior knowledge and motivation.

Defining objectives for a lesson is essential because it helps us to focus the
rest of our time on developing content that is necessary to help learners reach these goals.
It will help us ensure we do not miss anything important or, conversely,
include anything superfluous that could use up valuable time or distract instructors and learners.

When defining objectives, the skills described should be observable/measurable
i.e. action verbs such as "explain," "choose," or "predict,"
rather than "know," "understand," or "appreciate."

- Foundational knowledge and understanding vs creative and analytical skills.
  - The former are required for the latter and,
    if your target audience is not arriving at your workshop with the relevant foundational knowledge and understanding,
    it is unrealistic to get them to succeed at analytic and creative tasks within your lesson.
  - Also: do not mix up the order of these
    e.g. by writing a formative assessment that requires analytic skills
    before your learners have had a chance to commit their foundational knowledge
    and understanding to long term memory.
  - Analytic and creative skills take longer to teach and to learn.
    Trying to fit too much content into a lesson is counter-productive[1][1].
- Try to write objectives that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART).

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Exercise: evaluating learning objectives (15 minutes)

Look at examples of learning objectives and identify how they could be improved.
Maybe provide a numbered list of objectives,
with a table beneath for learners to identify the verb,
whether the objective is specific and measurable.

Discuss as a group how each might be improved.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Exercise: defining objectives for your lesson (20 minutes)

Write SMART learning objectives for your lesson -
what do you want learners to be able to do at the end of the workshop?


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Exercise: reviewing lesson objectives (15 minutes)

Swap objectives written in the previous exercise with a partner
(you can also explain or show them what you wrote about your target audience, but this not essential)
and review them with the following questions in mind:

- Are the objectives clear?
- Do they use "action" verbs?
- Could you directly observe whether a learner had reached this objective?

Now run the objectives through [https://web.cs.manchester.ac.uk/iloadvisor/](https://web.cs.manchester.ac.uk/iloadvisor/)
Do the results match your assessment?

- Where do the skills described in these objectives sit on the scale?
- (optional) Are these objectives realistic, given the target audience of the lesson?
