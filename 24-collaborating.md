- how to use GitHub to keep track of what needs doing: issues, assigning people to them, labelling them

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Report and track issues with the GitHub interface.
- Review and provide feedback on contributions from collaborators.
- Prepare for a decision-making meeting between collaborators.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How can I use GitHub to manage a lesson development project?
- What communication channels are effective for a lesson development team?
- What strategies exist to help collaborators make decisions and govern an open source project?

## Exercises: creating issues (15 minutes)

After your trial run,
you should have created a list of issues you identified with your lesson.
Open issues on the GitHub repository for your lesson,
for each item on that list.
Remember to add labels to each issue according to its type, priority, etc.
As you create them,
you may also want to assign these issues to a member of your lesson development team.

- using Slack and other platforms to discuss lesson development
- reviewing pull requests TODO figure out how to teach this practically
- making decisions and establishing governance structures
  - when your collaborator group exceeds 3-4 (fewer if the collaborators do not all know each other equally well at the outset) or to mitigate for power imbalances, you should establish and document some kind process of decision-making e.g. Martha's Rules. Better to do this early, as introducing structure and process only becomes more difficult and complicated as time goes on and the project grows. Plus, you will likely only realise you need an agreed way to make decisions when you encounter your first real disagreement.

  - Possible inspiration: [GitHub's Minimum Viable Governance](https://github.com/github/MVG) - designed for a one org-many projects setup, which is too elaborate for a single lesson project. But includes boilerplate for a steering committee, language laying out a preference for consensus but with voting as a fallback, and other text that is potentially helpful for those starting out and unsure about how to start with establishing governance.
    - In reality, consensus-based governance can run you into trouble when you hit an issue where maintainers do not all agree but still want to make progress. A voting/majority system helps you get around this.
    - Another issue with MVG is that "good faith" is open to interpretation and leaves plenty of room for the powerful to get away with acting in bad faith.
