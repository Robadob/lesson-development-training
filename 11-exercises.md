- A brief description of working vs long-term memory and
  why exercises/opportunities to practice are so important to include in a lesson.
  - Exercises help learners transfer knowledge from working memory to long term memory,
    clearing space for more new information
- Exercise formats and when to use them
  - You can design exercises based on the actions/skills you described in your learning objectives (the learning outcomes you intend for the lesson).
  - You can benefit here from using specific action verbs in your objectives -
    it will be much easier to decide what an exercise should ask learners to do
    if you know what kind of action you expect them to be able to perform.
    E.g. "explain" and "describe" outcomes may be better assessed by discussions
    and multiple choice questions, while "solve," "construct," "test" and other
    higher-level cognitive skills may be better assessed by debugging tasks,
    code-and-run, or use-in-a-different-context exercises.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Choose the format for an exercise based on the outcome it is intended to measure.
- Display exercises and their solutions in a lesson site.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- Why are exercises so important in a lesson?
- What are some different types of exercises, and when should they be used?
- How should exercises be presented in a lesson website?

## Exercise: exercise types and when to use them (15 minutes)

The Trainers will assign you to pairs or small groups,
and give each group an exercise type to focus on.
Each group should assign a notetaker,
to summarise your discussion at the end of the exercise.

Read about your given exercise type
[in the *Exercise Types* chapter of *Teaching Tech Together*](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:exercises) by following the relevant link below.

- [fill-in-the-blanks][blanks]
- [Parsons problems][parsons]
- [minimal fix][minimal]

Then, discuss the following questions together:

- What kind of skills would an exercise of this type assess?
  Try to identify some action verbs like those we used to write lesson objectives earlier in the workshop.
- Would this type of exercise be suited to a novice audience?
  Or is it a better fit for intermediate or advanced learners?
- Would this kind of exercise work well in an in-person workshop setting?
  Would it be better suited to self-directed learning and/or a virtual workshop?

Share the major points of your discussion in the collaborative notes document.

- different types of learning objectives work better for novices,
  while others are a better fit for competent practitioners, etc
  [Kirschner, 2006](https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/blob/gh-pages/files/papers/kirschner-minimal-guidance-fails-2006.pdf) -
  choose your objectives to fit your intended audience,
  and your exercise formats to fit your objectives.

*"Different types of LOs are better fit for novices,
while others are better fit for competent practitioners, etc and
if exercises (formative assessments) are well aligned to LOs,
\[they\] will automatically serve the corresponding audience.
Thinking in terms of LOs
(What should a learner do in order to achieve this specific LO?
Is this LO exactly what learners are expected to achieve by the end of this piece of instruction? etc.)
is easier than thinking in terms of LOs + audience + content.
LOs should be tailored to the audience, and,
if this is well done, you may stop worrying about the audience.
Create LOs for the specific audience and create assessments for specific LOs."*

\- Dr. Allegra Via, Carpentries Instructor Trainer

The worked example effect -
worked examples are more effective than problem-solving for novices,
less effective (even counter-productive) for competent practitioners.
Allegra: worked examples cannot be used to achieve high Bloom's levels of cognitive complexity
(critical thinking/problem solving),
that's why they are not effective for competent practitioners.
If you create exercises suitable for low Bloom's level LOs,
they will be effective for novices but NOT for competent practitioners.

## Exercise: assessing an objective (30 minutes)

Using one of the exercise formats you have learned about so far,
design an exercise that will require learners to perform one of the actions
described in the objectives you wrote for your lesson,
and that assesses their ability to do so.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Well-designed exercises are one of the most valuable resources for an Instructor:
time spent on this is well invested.

Demonstration of how to write an exercise within the lesson infrastructure,
including how to add a solution box.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Exercise: formatting exercises in a lesson site (15 minutes)

Using the approach demonstrated above,
format the MCQ you designed previously as an exercise in your lesson site.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Other types of formative assessment:

- think, pair, share
- sticky notes and written feedback

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Exercise: more practice with special blockquotes (10 minutes)

Return to the bullet list of lesson objectives you added to the `index.md` file of your lesson and
use special blockquotes to display it in a formatted box with the `.prereq` class.
