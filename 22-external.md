   - contact information (README, CONTRIBUTING)
   - guidance on how people should contribute, and what kinds of contribution you are most interested in receiving (CONTRIBUTING)
   - links to any important background information (README)
   - links to any funding bodies or host institutes that are supporting the development of the lesson (README)
2. Create a new issue or pull request template, or modfy an existing one,
   to guide contributors on how best to begin collaborating with you on GitHub.

## Exercise: planning to collaborate (10 minutes)

Use this time to plan how you will continue to make progress
with developing your lesson, and ensure that you are ready to respond to
external contributors when they arrive at your lesson.
This time is yours to do with as you think is best for yourself and your project,
but you might consider using it to do one or more of the following:

1. schedule a colesson development -working session with your collaborators,
   and/or mark the next community co-working session in your calendar.
2. ensure that your the notification settings are appropriately configured for
   your lesson repository.
3. contact The Carpentries team to ensure issues from your lesson will be
   included on the Help Wanted page.
