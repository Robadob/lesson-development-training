Welcome back!
In this section of the training,
we will learn more about the skills and tools you can use to become
an effective collaborator on an open source lesson.
Before moving on to cover that,
we will spend some time reflecting on and discussing the experience of
teaching new lesson material for the first time.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Reflect on the experience of teaching part of a lesson for the first time.
- Identify changes and improvements that can be made as a result of trialling lesson material.

re-introduce yourself and remind the group about the lesson you have been working on.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In the break since last time,
you should have trialled some of the lesson you set out to develop in
this training.
We will use this session to reflect on that experience,
and take some steps to ensure that the feedback and notes you gathered during
the trial run are used to improve the quality of your lesson.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  discussion

## Discussion: trial runs (35 minutes)

Look back at the notes you took after you completed your trial run (5 mins)

Now report out to the other participants about that trial run.
Try to answer the following questions:
